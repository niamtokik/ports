$OpenBSD: patch-src_sanity_cc,v 1.1 2021/03/29 06:20:56 rsadowski Exp $

A function macro named E clashes with internal boost definitions.  Rearrange
the order of header inclusion so that affected boost headers are included
before monotone defines the macro.

Also, stop bundling boost/circular_buffer, which is available in current
versions of boost. From Fedora.
