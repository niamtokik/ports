Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information
from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic
idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

# Discontinuation notice

You should use the 'beautifulsoup4' package instead of this package.

Development on the 3.x release of Beautiful Soup ended in 2011. With
the sunsetting of Python 2 in 2020, the 3.x release of Beautiful Soup
will be discontinued so that the 'beautifulsoup' package name can be
used by a more recent release that supports Python 3.

January 1, 2021 is the cutoff date.
