# - examples have conflicts (libevent, libevent2, libev)
# - hpack-tools require a C++11 compiler (array)
# Both of these pull in additional libraries; deliberately trying to keep
# dependencies light for this port, to avoid pulling in the world, and
# to avoid restricting arch.

# Tests don't do much unless cunit is present at configure time.
# As above, don't pull this in, to avoid restricting arch.
