$OpenBSD: patch-redis_conf,v 1.25 2021/02/25 15:05:23 tb Exp $

Redis TLSv1.3 support is conditional on TLS1_3_VERSION being public.
This is not currently the case and the ciphersuites config is a no-op.

Main changes in this file:

* Redis socket and pid files were moved to /var/run/redis
* Suggest using the system-wide root certificates /etc/ssl/certs.pem
* Using TLSv1.3 will currently trigger a log warning
* redis will daemonize and use syslog
