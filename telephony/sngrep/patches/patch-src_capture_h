$OpenBSD: patch-src_capture_h,v 1.1.1.1 2021/04/28 19:12:30 sthen Exp $

This isn't really "old libpcap", it's a local OpenBSD change to make
pcap files MI. Upstream libpcap does this differently by using timevals
directly, and converting in the file load/save routines instead.

Fix by removing the compile "fix" and copy the struct members rather
than returning them directly. Fixes hard loop when viewing INVITEs.
